  "So on Valentine’s Day, I ordered flowers for this girl I’d been kind of seeing. Nothing super serious, but I thought it’d be a nice gesture. Just something small.",
  "I was in a rush and typed her address too fast. Didn’t even notice I mixed up two numbers in her apartment. Hit place order and went on with my day. Got the delivery confirmation a couple hours later but no text. No thank you, no these are beautiful nothing. Just silence.",
  "Next day, still nothing. By day three, I figured alright, cool, guess that’s over. Kinda sucked but whatever. Then someone knocked on my door.",
  "This woman’s standing there with the flowers in her hands. I didn’t recognize her at first.",
  "She goes, Hey these showed up at my place. I almost threw them out but they were too pretty. Figured I’d try to get them to the right person. I was like Oh. Wow. Yeah. Those were for someone who didn’t really answer.",
  "She smiled and said, Their loss."
